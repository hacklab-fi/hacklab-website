# Hacklab

Hacklabs and hackerspaces stand for an open, community organized workspaces. These spaces are sometimes also called makerspaces, hackspaces, and with many other nomikers. Common in global Hackerspace movement and hacklab.fi principal idea is to maintain self-sustained and independently functioning workspaces. Education institutions also have workrooms and laboratories, but these are often open only for their own students. Hacklab instead is available 24h using your own key, whenever you need a workspace.

# Open for anyone

Hacklabs are hobbyist operated workspaces, and anyone has a possibility to join as a member. Important part of activity is sharing knowledge and helping each others. Members of hacklabs can learn from their peers and pass their skills forward to others. Hacklab brings together craft skills, technology, creative working, designing and experimenting. Besides your own building, you can help developing the workspace and participate in shared projects.

Hacklab is open for everyone, but sometimes requires some level of independent working skills. There might be suitable events for junior members and school age kids in your local hacklab.
